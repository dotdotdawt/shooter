shooter
=======
Reworking a project that was made by a student of mine. It was originally supposed to be Space Invaders with a sausage gun. While helping them with some instant enemy death problems (no damage cooldown) I got inspired and wanted to make a really good shooter game. When I'm done with this I want to rework this whole project into a Tower Defense type game.
